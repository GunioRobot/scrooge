h1. Scrooge

A Framework and ORM agnostic Model / record attribute tracker to ensure production
Ruby applications only fetch the database content needed to minimize wire traffic
and reduce conversion overheads to native Ruby types.

This is mostly an experiment into unobtrusive tracking, respecting development workflows
and understanding Rack internals better.
